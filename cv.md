# My story:
After finishing school, I was looking for the essential goal of my life, but did not find any. Therefore, in 2017 I started my career as a porter in a home chemical storehouse. This experience was remarkable and pretty weighty. 

It gave me fundamental skills, such as carrying, reliability, and creativity in solving problems my team was facing during the working process. And what is the most important-this experience made it clear to me that I was born for something vaster than being a porter. So I am here, studying front-end and willing to become the best on the block.
